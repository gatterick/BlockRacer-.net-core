Introduction:

Blockracer is a fast-pace (or slow if you prefer that) turn-based game where
each player controls a car on a race-track.

Specification:

The REST-api is as follows; as long as the client fulfills this it will be 
compatible with this implementation of the server:

The following endpoints exists

<url>/v1/maps
<url>/v1/players
<url>/v1/races

Each endpoint is separate from eachother and by querying the individual endpoints
